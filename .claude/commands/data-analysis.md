# Data Analysis

## Purpose
Evaluate data storage, data models, and data flow patterns to identify issues with data quality, access, and management.

## Instructions
1. Analyze data storage systems:
   - Inventory all data storage systems (databases, file systems, caches, etc.)
   - Document storage type and technology choices
   - Evaluate storage capacity and growth patterns
   - Check for appropriate indexing and query optimization
   - Identify access patterns and bottlenecks
   - Assess backup and recovery procedures

2. Evaluate data models:
   - Analyze database schemas and entity relationships
   - Check for normalization/denormalization appropriate to use case
   - Identify data duplication and inconsistencies
   - Assess schema evolution and migration strategies
   - Check for appropriate constraints and data integrity measures
   - Evaluate performance implications of data model

3. Map data flows:
   - Identify data sources and endpoints
   - Document data transformation processes
   - Map ETL processes and data pipelines
   - Analyze data synchronization mechanisms
   - Assess timeliness of data updates
   - Identify manual data handling steps

4. Assess data quality:
   - Check for data validation rules
   - Identify data quality issues (duplicates, missing values, etc.)
   - Analyze data consistency across systems
   - Evaluate data freshness and update frequency
   - Check for orphaned or unused data
   - Assess data retention policies

5. Evaluate data access patterns:
   - Document who accesses what data and how
   - Identify authorization and access control mechanisms
   - Analyze read/write patterns and volumes
   - Check for appropriate caching strategies
   - Identify potential contention or locking issues
   - Assess query performance and optimization

6. Check for data governance issues:
   - Data ownership and stewardship
   - Compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Data classification and sensitivity handling
   - Data lifecycle management
   - Audit trails for sensitive data operations
   - Privacy controls and anonymization

## Output Format
Provide a structured report with sections for:

1. Data storage system inventory and assessment
2. Data model evaluation
3. Data flow mapping and analysis
4. Data quality assessment
5. Data access pattern analysis
6. Data governance evaluation
7. Prioritized recommendations for data management improvement
