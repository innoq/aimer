# Development Process Analysis

## Purpose
Identify organizational and process issues that manifest as technical problems, evaluating development workflows, team dynamics, and process efficiency.

## Instructions
1. Analyze development team structure and dynamics:
   - Team organization and responsibilities
   - Cross-team dependencies
   - Knowledge sharing mechanisms
   - Expert dependencies (key person risks)
   - Collaboration patterns
   - Decision-making processes
2. Evaluate development workflow efficiency:
   - Requirements gathering and refinement
   - Sprint/iteration planning
   - Task allocation and tracking
   - Code review process
   - Testing procedures
   - Release and deployment processes
   - Incident management
3. Identify communication patterns and issues:
   - Communication between development teams
   - Dev-ops collaboration
   - Business-IT communication
   - Documentation practices
   - Knowledge transfer mechanisms
   - Meeting efficiency
4. Assess quality assurance processes:
   - Test coverage and strategy
   - Automated testing implementation
   - Manual testing procedures
   - Bug tracking and resolution
   - Non-functional testing
   - Acceptance testing
   - Technical debt management
5. Evaluate development metrics:
   - Cycle time
   - Lead time
   - Deployment frequency
   - Change failure rate
   - Mean time to recovery
   - Bug detection rates
   - Technical debt accumulation
6. Identify process-related bottlenecks:
   - Handoff delays
   - Approval processes
   - Environment availability
   - Test environment management
   - Release scheduling
   - Documentation requirements

## Output Format
Provide a structured report with sections for:

1. Team structure and dynamics assessment
2. Development workflow evaluation
3. Communication pattern analysis
4. Quality assurance process assessment
5. Key metrics and trends
6. Identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies
7. Recommendations for process improvements
