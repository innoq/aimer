# Deployment and Infrastructure Analysis

## Purpose
Evaluate deployment processes, infrastructure configuration, and operational readiness to identify risks, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.

## Instructions
1. Analyze deployment processes:
   - Deployment frequency and scheduling
   - Build and deployment automation
   - Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
   - Rollback procedures
   - Database schema updates
   - Feature flag management
   - Environment promotion flow
2. Evaluate infrastructure configuration:
   - Infrastructure-as-code implementation
   - Cloud provider utilization
   - Server/container configurations
   - Load balancing and scaling mechanisms
   - Network topology and security
   - Storage systems
   - Resource allocation and utilization
3. Assess monitoring and observability:
   - Logging implementation and centralization
   - Metrics collection and dashboards
   - Alerting rules and thresholds
   - Distributed tracing
   - Error tracking
   - Service health checks
   - On-call procedures
4. Analyze reliability and resilience:
   - Single points of failure
   - Failover mechanisms
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Backup strategies
   - Load testing results
   - Chaos engineering practices
   - Incident response procedures
5. Evaluate operational efficiency:
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Resource utilization
   - Deployment pipeline efficiency
   - Environment management
   - Drift detection and management
   - Toil reduction
   - Automation opportunities
6. Assess security posture:
   - Network segmentation
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Secret management
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Patch management
   - Compliance with security standards

## Output Format
Provide a structured report with sections for:

1. Deployment process assessment
2. Infrastructure configuration evaluation
3. Monitoring and observability analysis
4. Reliability and resilience assessment
5. Operational efficiency recommendations
6. Security posture evaluation
7. Prioritized improvement recommendations
