2. Role-specific questions:
   a. For developers:
   - Where is the code most difficult to change or extend?
   - What parts of the system have the most bugs or incidents?
   - What technical debt concerns you most?
   - What tools or processes slow down your development work?
   b. For architects:
   - How well does the current architecture support business needs?
   - What architectural decisions do you now regret?

   c. For operations:
   - What causes the most production incidents?
