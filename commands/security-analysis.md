# Security Analysis

## Purpose
Identify security vulnerabilities, risks, and compliance issues within the system architecture and implementation.

## Instructions
1. Analyze authentication and authorization:
   - Authentication mechanisms used
   - Authorization models and implementation
   - Session management
   - Password policies and storage
   - Multi-factor authentication implementation
   - API security (keys, tokens, OAuth)
2. Examine data protection practices:
   - Sensitive data identification
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Key management
   - Data masking/anonymization
   - PII handling procedures
   - Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
3. Identify common security vulnerabilities:
   - Input validation weaknesses
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vectors
   - SQL injection possibilities
   - Command injection risks
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
   - File upload vulnerabilities
   - Insecure deserialization
4. Analyze infrastructure security:
   - Network security configuration
   - Firewall rules and access controls
   - Container/VM security
   - Cloud service configuration
   - Privileged access management
   - Secrets management
5. Evaluate security observability:
   - Logging of security events
   - Monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Alerting mechanisms
   - Incident response procedures
   - Audit trails for sensitive operations
6. Assess security processes:
   - Secure development lifecycle
   - Dependency scanning
   - Security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
   - Security update procedures
   - Vulnerability management

## Output Format
Provide a structured report with sections for:
1. Executive summary of security posture
2. Authentication and authorization assessment
3. Data protection evaluation
4. Vulnerability identification with severity ratings
5. Infrastructure security analysis
6. Security monitoring and response evaluation
7. Prioritized recommendations with remediation strategies
