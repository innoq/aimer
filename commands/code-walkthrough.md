# Code Walkthrough

## Purpose
Trace execution paths through code to evaluate business logic implementation, cross-cutting concerns, and architectural consistency.

## Instructions
1. Select a specific business use case to trace:
   - [Describe the significant use case or business flow to analyze]
   - Starting points (API endpoints, UI interactions, etc.)
   - Expected outcomes and business rules
2. Perform a static code analysis to trace the execution path:
   - Entry point identification
   - Control flow through functions/methods
   - Call hierarchy
   - Data transformations
   - External dependencies and services invoked
   - Exit points and result handling
3. For each segment of the execution path, analyze:
   - Code organization and structure
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Performance considerations
   - Security practices
   - Logging and observability
   - Transaction management
   - Resource utilization
4. Evaluate cross-cutting concerns implementation:
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Input validation
   - Output sanitization
   - Logging consistency
   - Error handling patterns
   - Transaction boundaries
   - Caching strategy
   - Feature flags/toggles
5. Assess architectural adherence:
   - Conformance to declared architecture
   - Appropriate separation of concerns
   - Adherence to development guidelines
   - Use of standard libraries and frameworks
   - Consistency with similar features
6. Identify potential issue areas:
   - Excessive complexity
   - Error-prone constructs
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Scalability limitations
   - Maintainability challenges

## Output Format
Provide a structured report with sections for:
1. Use case summary and entry points
2. Execution path diagram or sequence
3. Analysis of implementation quality
4. Cross-cutting concerns evaluation
5. Architectural consistency assessment
6. Identified issues and recommendations
