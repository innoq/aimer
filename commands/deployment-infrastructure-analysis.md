# Deployment and Infrastructure Analysis Prompt

## Purpose
Evaluate deployment processes, infrastructure configuration, and operational readiness to identify risks, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities. Focus on understanding how infrastructure choices impact system reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Context
Infrastructure and deployment practices directly impact system reliability and team productivity. Poor deployment processes create bottlenecks and risks, while infrastructure problems often manifest as application issues. This analysis examines both technical infrastructure and operational practices.
