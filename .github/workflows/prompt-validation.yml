            Review this pull request specifically for AIMER prompt quality compliance.
            
            Focus ONLY on changed files in the commands/ directory that end with .md
            
            For each changed prompt file:
            1. Read and analyze it against the guidelines in prompt-guideline.md
            2. Check for ALL of these requirements:
               - Contains all required sections: Purpose, Context, Instructions, Output Format, Success Criteria
               - Ends with $ARGUMENTS placeholder
               - Uses imperative, direct language (no "You should..." patterns)
               - Avoids role-based prompting (no "You are a..." patterns)
               - Has explicit, well-structured output format specification
               - Instructions are clear and logically structured
            
            Provide a detailed validation report with:
            - File name and validation status (‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL / ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING)
            - Specific issues found with line numbers where possible
            - Constructive suggestions for fixing any issues
