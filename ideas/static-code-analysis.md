# Static Code Analysis

## Purpose
Systematically evaluate code quality, identify structural issues, and detect potential bugs or vulnerabilities through automated and manual analysis. Focus on finding patterns that indicate deeper architectural or process problems.

## Context
Static code analysis provides objective data about code quality and helps identify areas where code complexity, technical debt, or poor practices create maintainability risks. This analysis should complement dynamic analysis and look for root causes, not just symptoms.

## Instructions

### 1. Analysis Strategy and Tool Selection

#### A. Multi-Layered Analysis Approach
Combine multiple analysis techniques:

**Automated Static Analysis**:
- Code complexity tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate, ESLint)
- Security scanners (CodeQL, Bandit, Brakeman)
- Dependency vulnerability scanners
- License compliance checkers

**Manual Code Review**:
- Architecture pattern adherence
- Business logic correctness
- Error handling patterns
- Performance implications

#### B. Language-Specific Tool Configuration
Ensure tools are properly configured for:
- Language-specific best practices
- Framework-specific patterns
- Project-specific rules and exceptions
- Security vulnerability patterns
- Performance anti-patterns

### 2. Code Quality Metrics Analysis

#### A. Complexity Metrics Assessment

**Structural Complexity**:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Decision point analysis
  - Target: Functions < 10, Classes < 20
  - Identify functions > 15 (high risk)
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Mental overhead measurement
- **Nesting Depth**: Deeply nested code identification
- **Function/Method Length**: Oversized function detection
- **Class Size**: God class identification

**Maintainability Metrics**:
- **Halstead Complexity**: Program difficulty measures
- **Maintainability Index**: Overall maintainability score
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Effort to fix vs. build time

#### B. Code Organization Assessment

**Coupling Analysis**:
- **Afferent Coupling (Ca)**: Incoming dependencies
- **Efferent Coupling (Ce)**: Outgoing dependencies
- **Instability (I)**: Ce / (Ca + Ce)
- **Abstractness (A)**: Abstract classes ratio
- **Distance from Main Sequence**: Balance of abstractness and stability

**Cohesion Analysis**:
- **Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)**: Class responsibility focus
- **Single Responsibility Principle** adherence
- **Interface Segregation** effectiveness

### 3. Code Smell Detection and Categorization

#### A. Systematic Code Smell Inventory

**Design Smells**:
- **Large Classes**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Long Methods**: Methods doing too much
- **Feature Envy**: Methods using other classes' data excessively
- **Data Classes**: Classes with only getters/setters
- **Refused Bequest**: Subclasses not using inherited methods

**Implementation Smells**:
- **Duplicated Code**: Copy-paste programming
- **Dead Code**: Unreachable or unused code
- **Primitive Obsession**: Overuse of primitive types
- **Long Parameter Lists**: Methods with too many parameters
- **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded values without explanation

**Architectural Smells**:
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Changes scattered across many classes
- **Divergent Change**: Class changing for multiple reasons
- **Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies**: Coupled inheritance trees
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes knowing too much about each other

#### B. Smell Impact Assessment
For each smell category:
- **Prevalence**: How widespread is this smell?
- **Severity**: How much does it impact maintainability?
- **Trend**: Is it getting better or worse over time?
- **Root Cause**: Why does this smell occur in this codebase?

### 4. Security and Reliability Analysis

#### A. Security Vulnerability Detection

**Common Vulnerability Patterns**:
- **Input Validation Issues**: Injection vulnerabilities

- Transitive dependency risks
- License compliance issues

#### B. Reliability Issue Detection

**Potential Bug Patterns**:
- **Null Pointer Risks**: Unguarded null dereferences
- **Resource Leaks**: Unclosed files, connections, streams
- **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions, deadlock potential
- **Exception Handling Gaps**: Unhandled exceptions, poor error recovery
- **Type Safety Issues**: Unsafe casts, conversion problems

### 5. Performance and Scalability Analysis

#### A. Performance Anti-Pattern Detection

**Common Performance Issues**:
- **N+1 Query Problems**: Database query inefficiencies
- **Premature Optimization**: Complex code without benefit
- **Memory Inefficiencies**: Unnecessary object creation
- **Algorithm Inefficiencies**: Poor algorithm choices

#### B. Scalability Risk Assessment
- **Resource Usage Patterns**: Memory and CPU intensive operations
- **Synchronization Points**: Potential bottlenecks
- **State Management**: Session state, global variables

### 6. Code Style and Convention Analysis

#### A. Consistency Assessment

**Naming Conventions**:
- Variable, function, class naming consistency
- Package/module organization patterns
- Constant and configuration naming

**Code Structure**:
- Indentation and formatting consistency
- Comment quality and frequency
- Import organization
- File organization patterns

#### B. Documentation Quality
- **API Documentation**: Public interface documentation
- **Inline Comments**: Code explanation quality
- **README and Setup**: Project documentation
- **Architecture Documentation**: High-level design docs

### 7. Trend Analysis and Historical Context

#### A. Quality Trend Tracking
If historical data is available:
- Code quality metric trends over time
- Technical debt accumulation patterns
- Defect injection rates
- Refactoring effectiveness

#### B. Correlation Analysis
- Relationship between complexity and bug reports
- Connection between code smells and maintenance effort
- Impact of coding standards on quality metrics
